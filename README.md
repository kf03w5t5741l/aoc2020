# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions to the 2020 run of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in C. So far 18 solutions have been added, all dating back to december 2020. Solutions to the remaining 7 problems will probably follow in december 2021.

Fair warning: quite a few different data structures were used, mainly to get practice implementing them by hand and experimenting with various notions of time complexity. Some solutions would have fared far better with simple hash tables.
